    <h1>Career Path</h1>
    <div class="about-career">
        <p>My professional career started in 1995 at Citibank, Turkey, as a member of the launching team of a retail banking branch in Turkey. Since then, throughout my career path, I mainly took roles in start-ups, launching a new business, entering new
            markets, building up new business functions, mostly in the multicultural environment.</p>
        <p>Besides my managerial role, I enjoy being a trusted companion of the managers within the corporate academy as a Blanchard accredited trainer of <a href="https://www.kenblanchard.com/">Situational Leadership (SL-II)</a> model and Certified Professional
            Coach by Adler International Central Europe.
        </p>
        <p>I’m currently occupied at LC Waikiki in an international role, responsible for the Europe region as well as the commercial product team of children’s wear departments at domestic retail stores. As the ‘Regional E-Commerce Merchandising and Commercial
            Director, I’m responsible for the commercial product availability at both E-commerce stores as well as traditional brick-and-mortar stores in Europe.</p>
        <p>As an active member of 2 non-governmental organizations (<a href="https://www.icfturkey.org/">ICF Turkey Chapter</a>, <a href="https://www.ted.org.tr/">Turkish Education Association</a>); I act as a project leader with a special focus on coaching
            university students on their career path.</p>
        <p>I am convinced that diversity and inclusion contribute to business results as well as the welfare of society. Gender balance is essential for facing business challenges in the retail and consumer goods industry, thus I am one of the founding board
            members of the <a href="http://www.leadturkey.net/">Lead Network Turkey Chapter</a>.</p>
